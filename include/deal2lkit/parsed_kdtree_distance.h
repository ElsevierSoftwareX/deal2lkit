/**
 * A deal2lkit wrapper for the nanoflann library, used to compute the
 * distance from a collection of points. This function uses nanoflann
 * to efficiently partition the space in a tree. The cost of each
 * query is then roughly of order log(n), where n is the number of
 * points stored in this class.
 *
 * Additional methods are provided that give access to other
 * functionalities of the nanoflann library, like searching the n
 * nearest neighbors, or searching the points that fall within a
 * raidius of a target point.
